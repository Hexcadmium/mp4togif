## FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions

### Why not use already built converters?
You can! There are many converters available. However, some of them may contain malware or does not produce the quality you want.

### Why did you make this?
This was made because I needed a simple way to convert MP4 files to GIFs without using potentially sketchy software or online converters.

### How do I know that you are not collecting my data?
As this is open-source, you are free to audit the source code of the web application. You are free to run this locally by following the steps in the deployment section if you are concerned about your privacy.

### Why not record and use tools such as Clipchamp to export `.mp4` to `.gif`?
It is possible to do it this way. However, there are potentially quality issues depending on the software.

### Why did you use AI to create this?
I needed a simple solution to a problem that I have. As I am by no means a programmer, this allows me to create a solution to a problem that I have without spending too much time on it.
