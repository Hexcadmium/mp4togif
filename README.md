# MP4 to GIF Converter - Project 1: mp4togif
The MP4 to GIF Converter is a web application that accepts `.mp4` files and converts it to `.gif` files made with the help of Microsoft Copilot.

This web application is meant to be run locally. Changes may be required if you wish to run this in a production environment.

## Why Build This?
This was built as I could not find an easy solution to record and save GIFs on Windows.

## Deployment
To deploy this, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Hexcadmium/mp4togif.git
cd mp4togif
npm install
npm start
```

## FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions

### Why not use already built converters?
You can! There are many converters available. However, some of them may contain malware or not produce the quality you want.

### Why did you make this?
This was made because I needed a simple way to convert MP4 files to GIFs without using sketchy software or online converters.

### How do I know you are not collecting my data?
As this is open-source, you are free to audit the source code of the web application. You are free to run this locally by following the steps in the deployment section if you are concerned about your privacy.

### Why not record and use tools such as Microsoft Clipchamp to export the `.mp4` files to `.gif`.
It is possible to do it this way. However, there are potentially quality issues depending on the software.

### Why did you use AI to create this?
I needed a simple solution to a problem that I have. As I am by no means a programmer, this allows me to create a solution to a problem that I have without spending too much time on it.
